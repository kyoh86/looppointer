## What's this?

Sample problem code from: https://github.com/kyoh86/looppointer/blob/master/testdata/simple/simple.go

```go
package main

func main() {
	var intSlice []*int

	println("loop expecting 10, 11, 12, 13")
	for _, p := range []int{10, 11, 12, 13} {
		intSlice = append(intSlice, &p) // want "taking a pointer for the loop variable p"
	}

	println(`slice expecting "10, 11, 12, 13" but "13, 13, 13, 13"`)
	for _, p := range intSlice {
		printp(p)
	}
}

func printp(p *int) {
	println(*p)
}
```

In Go, the `p` variable in the above loops is actually a single variable.
So in many case (like the above), using it makes for us annoying bugs.

You can find them with `looppointer`, and fix it.

```go
package main

func main() {
	var intSlice []*int

	println("loop expecting 10, 11, 12, 13")
	for i, p := range []int{10, 11, 12, 13} {
    p := p                          // FIX variable into the inner variable
		intSlice = append(intSlice, &p) 
	}

	println(`slice expecting "10, 11, 12, 13"`)
	for _, p := range intSlice {
		printp(p)
	}
}

func printp(p *int) {
	println(*p)
}
```

## Sensing policy

I want to make looppointer as nervous as possible.
So many false-positves will be reported.

e.g.

```go
func TestSample(t *testing.T) {
  for _, p := []int{10, 11, 12, 13} {
    t.Run(func(t *testing.T) {
      s = &p // t.Run always called instantly, so it will not be bug.
      ...
    })
  }
}
```

They can be escaped with pining-variable:

```go
func TestSample(t *testing.T) {
  for _, p := []int{10, 11, 12, 13} {
    p := p // pin a variable to local in the loop
    t.Run(func(t *testing.T) {
      s = &p
      ...
    })
  }
}
```

If you want to ignore false-positives (with some lints ignored),
you should use [exportloopref](https://github.com/kyoh86/exportloopref).
